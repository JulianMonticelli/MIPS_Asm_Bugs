A project for CS0447 in the Spring Semester of 2016. This program was written in MIPS assembly, specifically for a version which has a LED Light simulator. If you own this version of the MIPS simulator, you can run this file by starting the LED simulator, connecting the simulator to MIPS, and starting the program.
